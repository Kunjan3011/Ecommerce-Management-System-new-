# E-commerce Management System

## Project Overview

The **E-commerce Management System** is a desktop-based application built to streamline inventory, user, and order management processes. Designed for both admins and customers, the system allows users to register, log in, and interact with product data and orders through a user-friendly graphical interface. The project leverages **Tkinter** for GUI design and **MySQL** for backend data storage and operations.

### Database Configuration
Set up the following tables in your MySQL database:

#### Users Table
Stores admin and customer user data.
```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,

```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    Category VARCHAR(100),
    Price DECIMAL(10,2),
    Stock INT NOT NULL
);
```

#### Orders Table
Stores customer order information.
```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    CustomerID INT,
    ProductID INT,
    Quantity INT,
